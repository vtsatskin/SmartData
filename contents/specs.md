### Entry Points

[![](images/specs/entry-points.png)](images/specs/entry-points.png)

In a multi-SIM situation, the settings view of *Figure 0.1* is the configuration
view for an individual SIM. Therefore pressing "Data usage and control" should
display that SIM when showing *Figure 1.0*.

### Usage Overview

[![](images/specs/usage-overview.png)](images/specs/usage-overview.png)

In a multi-SIM configuration, the SIM chosen for data connectivity in the SIM
Manager should be active view which is shown in *Figure 1.0*. The ordering of
the SIMs in the tab bar should not change.

The bar graphs for each application's usage should be proportional to the limit
displayed. In the case that an app's usage is too small to be shown accurately
as a bar graph, a small sliver should be shown as in the Map application in
*Figure 1.2*.

Usage bars which go above the limit should display a full bar graph along with
a visual style which indicates this. As an example, *Figure 1.2* shows the bars
displayed in red. The visual style should be sensitive to cultural meanings of
colours.
