These are concept ideas for smart data sharing

## Having a more understandable mental model of data

Apple made communicating to users how many songs their iPods could hold not by
talking about their devices in terms of the bytes they could hold, instead
they talked about the number of songs they could hold.

Referring to data consumption in terms of pages, apps, and other usage metrics
is probably more understandable than bytes. Even if it's just an estimate, it's
probably more useful, especially for people who have never had to deal with
computer metrics before.
