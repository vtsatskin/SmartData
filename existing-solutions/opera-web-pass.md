# Opera Web Pass

[Product Page](http://www.operasoftware.com/products/web-pass)

Allows operators to package internet services to be based on time and or content
instead of per MB. This can make decisions for users easier because it relates
to terms they understand instead of MBs.

Users can buy packages to use the internet for a specified amount of time (e.g 3
minutes, an hour, a day, etc). They can also buy packages that enable a specific
application to work (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, etc). [1]

Opera believes Web Pass makes mobile data offerings "understandable and
affordable" to their users. [2]

This solution requires the Opera web browser.

> The system doesn’t require heavy integration efforts on the operator’s side,
as it supports third-party billing, header forwarding and Opera Mini zero
rating, so the operator can quickly deploy the solution for their customers
using low-end devices and feature phones. It also uses Opera’s data compression
technologies, to reduce data costs even further. [3]

## Sponsored Web Pass

> Sponsored Web Pass enables operators to easily team up with advertisers to
sponsor the cost of customers' mobile internet access, providing users with free
mobile data. [1]
