# BlackBerry DataSmart

DataSmart is a compression technology which proxies requests made by BlackBerry
devices through a server in order to save on data costs. It is similar to
Opera's compression technologies except for the lack of video compression.

> BlackBerry smartphones with DataSmart technology enable up to 2x more web
browsing, 4x more email and 2x more social networking than other leading
smartphones within your fixed data plan. According to Peter Rysavy, benefits of
BlackBerry smartphones with DataSmart technology could include lower monthly
service plans, faster application operation and increased battery life. [1], [2]
